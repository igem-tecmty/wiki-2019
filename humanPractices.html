                  In order to learn more about antibiotic resistance in our country,
                  we contacted the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico.
                  Thanks to the institute, we were able to talk with the members of the research
                  line in medicines in public health about the access and usage of antibiotics

                  On May 16, a call was made with Anahi Dreser, a
                  researcher specialized in antibiotic usage, health
                  policies and quality of care of the National Institute
                  of Public Health. With this call we were able to know a little
                  more about the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Mexico
                  and analyze alternatives to generate an impact on society.
                  She told us that the magnitude of the problem itself is unknown.
                  This can be associated to the lack of license in the collection of
                  information by governmental entities.

              <p class="col-md-12 description-text">
                  In addition, there is a record that Mexican doctors tend to misuse antibiotics and
                  that patients do not follow their prescribed treatment. We could also discuss the
                  impact that a device like the one we propose and the human practices we plan will
                  have. Dr. Dreser talked to us about the importance of creating a culture of antibiotics,
                  and its importance in modern day.

              <p class="col-md-12 description-text">
                Held in the campus, this meeting helped us to modify the focus of the
                project, specifically because he pointed out that in our country the treatment
                for CF patients is inaccessible for most of the population, due to its high cost,
                which reduces the life expectancy in Mexico. Originally, one of the objectives of
                the new  mucolytic was to reduce the secondary effects of the commonly used
                treatments by encapsulating the drug and regulating its distribution in the body ().

                We consider that one of the most relevant facts that Dr. Albino Rivas mentioned, was
                that doctors can never give CF patients the same antibiotic on 4 occasions, because
                of the large possibility of antibiotic resistance development. Also, he gave us a
                large quantity of information that helped us corroborate the veracity of the data we

                Due to the relevance of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, the team focused on the erroneous use of antibiotics, which is one of the main causes of this problem. In Mexico, laws have been created to avoid the purchase of antibiotics without a medical prescription, but these have shown ineffective. In addition, the packages of these medications lack inserts that give consumers sufficient information for its correct use. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For the above, this information was exposed in the Congress of Nuevo León,  
                The approaches with the experts made us see that innovations in the area of ​​health in our country may become obsolete due to the deficiencies of the same health system. In a nutshell, it is no use for finding new antibiotics or creating new medications if people or institutions are going to misuse them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The inadequate prescription of antibiotics in the Mexican public sector is a serious problem. It has been shown that respiratory and stomach infections are the worst treated. According to Gutierrez et al, "Research carried out mostly during the 1980s and 1990s, concluded that between 60 and 80% of patients with HAIs and EDAS received antibiotics in public and private primary health services in the country, when in fact their use was justified only in 10 to 15% of the cases. "(2008). Additionally, it is known that justified prescriptions are made in the most advanced hospitals. Nevertheless, many of the doses or treatments provided were excessive, which represents a serious threat to patients. In conclusion, most antibiotic prescriptions are unjustified or inadequate and this has negative consequences for society.
              </p>
              <p>
                In monetary terms, the inappropriate use of antibiotics comes to represent 11% of the public spending in health. This expense is caused by incorrect prescriptions and the lack of follow-up of treatments by patients. In addition, the incorrect prescriptions of medications come to represent 1 or 2 percent more than the patient's daily minimum wage. The bad prescriptions come to represent a large economic spill that affects the Mexican economy.

                In Mexico, a large part of the strategies implemented has been in the educational area and directives of the health sector. First, training in prescriptions in medical schools began to improve. This was intended to improve prescriptions for respiratory and stomach infections. In the same way, the use of clinical guidelines for better prescriptions in public health institutes was encouraged. Nevertheless, there is no study that talks about the results of the implementation of these techniques. In a few words, it has sought to improve prescriptions in Mexico, but it is not known if it is working.
                In order to begin a change in the subject of legislation in the area of ​​health, iGEM Tec Monterrey began to promote an amendment to the Official Mexican Standard NOM-072-SSA1-2012. This rule establishes the guidelines to follow in the labeling of medicines in Mexico, of which we proposed an improvement in the warnings about the damage of antibiotics and the modification of an article to force pharmaceutical companies to improve their labeling and the information provided about your medications.
                Our strategy was to start with the modification of a rule that directly affects society. With this modification, clearer and more concise information on medicines would be offered to society. This type of modification would lead to the proper use of free medications and antibiotics, as well as to warn in a stronger way the risk involved in the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
                In addition to the above, it will be a precedent to propose further modifications in the national health sector. Modifications that seek to establish a clearer authority for the health sector, strengthen health regulations and improve the education system of the health sciences area.
                In order to make our proposal a reality, we took on the task of seeking help in the local congress of the state of Nuevo León (Mexico), where we were able to collaborate with the deputy Rosa Isela Castro who is part of the health commission.
                Initially, we were able to present our bill to the deputy and her team, with them we were able to discuss the pros and cons of this initiative, in addition to the legal mechanisms to make it happen. With this meeting we could review our proposed law at the federal level, which was as follows:
              </p>
              <p>  
                Secondly, an exhort was prepared for the secretary of health of the state of Nuevo León, with which he was invited to begin the process to make this modification to the Mexican congress. This exhortation was analyzed and approved unanimously by the Congress of Nuevo León and set the first precedent for this proposed law.
                The exhort to the secretary of health was as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V0AV15-EbSfu6HjL3hc6NgXD8FetTj7U">(Copia del exhorto presentado en el congreso)</a>  
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to this collaboration with the local congress we were able to make our proposed law modification more efficient and use the appropriate legal mechanisms to create the desired change throughout Mexico.
