              Mexico's Educational Context
            </h2>

            <p>
              Education in Mexico has a long way to go. There are many barriers
              that make it difficult to progress as well as it should. Problems
              with corruption, political and logistical issues are among the
              main factors that affect students’ education all around the
              country. According to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation
              and Development (OCDE), Mexico is the lowest ranking country in
              terms of education. In cases when the access to education is
              available, many students face a wide range of issues surrounding
              this basic human right. Even when the government’s aim is to
              further implement innovative educational programs, pursuing
              technological and bilingual schooling, usually these disappear
              after a short period of time either because there is not enough
              money being directed at financing them, schools are not equipped
              with books and other materials, there are no available teachers
              that can implement them among students, or the students are simply
              preoccupied by poverty, lack of access to food or violence.[1]

              <h3>Scientific Education in Mexico</h3>
              <p class="mt-2">
                In regards to scientific education in Mexico specifically,
                there are some other issues. According to the Survey on Public
                Perception of Science and Technology, ENPECYT by its acronym
                in Spanish
              </p>

                <li>
                  86.2% have not taken any subjects on Biotechnology or
                  Agropecuary Sciences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  70% believe antibiotics are useful to treat illnesses caused

                  regarding new inventions, scientific discoveries and
                  technological advances and 29% believe they do not know
                  anything about this.

              <p>
                Not only is there a need to boost education in Mexico, but
                science education is even more neglected. Mexico’s schooling
                is far from ideal, but this also means there are enormous
                areas of opportunity we can take advantage of to try and
                improve things at least a little bit. We wanted to implement
                different strategies in order to reach a variety of members
                within our communities.

                <p>
                  When we started planning our Education and Public Engagement
                  activities, we faced many challenges because we did not
                  initially know how to approach the problem. To resolve this,
                  we were able to contact various experts who were able to give
                  us guidance on the subject and thus set specific goals of what
                  we wanted to achieve. One of those experts was PhD. Cristina
                  Reynaga. Dr Reynaga has a PhD in genetics but has been working
                  since 2003 on developing proposals for the scientific
                  education of blind and visually impaired students. From this
                  first approach, we realized that we actually had a lot of
                  things within reach and our role was to discern between
                  activities that would really have the potential to penetrate
                  people's knowledge and those that would not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of the members of our team had the opportunity to give
                  science workshops to teenagers and many times the problem is
                  that, due to all the issues in the Mexican educational system,
                  young people have never had a healthy approach to this area of
                  knowledge that is nowadays fundamental for many technological
                  advances, so instead of attracting their attention, they start
                  to lose interest in the subject, either “because it is
                  difficult”, or the teacher does not succeed in attracting
                  their attention with the limited resources that the school
                  has.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After reflecting on this, we concluded that we should avoid
                  applying one-day activities, but rather work that could be
                  used in the future, either by other iGEM teams or
                  organizations seeking to promote scientific education,
                  particularly in relation to Synthetic Biology.

                We looked at
                different segments in our population and sought to identify
                areas of opportunity in which we could implement a way in
                which we shared our knowledge and received knowledge,
                establishing a two-way conversation and learning along
                everybody else involved. Taking this into consideration, we

              <h3>Context of education and disabilities in Mexico</h3>
              <p>
                In Mexico, according to our National Institute of Statistics and
                Geography (INEGI) 44% percent of the total population of varying
                disabilities finish basic education (Elementary). This percentage
                decreases to 15.4% for middle school and 6.7 % to higher
                education. The main problem that causes this decrease in the level
                of education is the lack of educational resources and training for
                teachers to make an inclusive classroom. This creates a snowball
                effect that significantly reduces the chances of a student with a
                disability to reach a degree because of the lack of materials for
                teaching basic concepts properly makes harder for them to learn
                the more complex subjects seen in college and high school
              </p>
              <p>
                From the total population of people with disabilities about 58.4%
                have a visual disability, making it the second most common
                disability, just under motor disabilities [3]. For this reason, we
                saw an area of opportunity to teach science to BVIS since we
                believe that science should be available for everyone no matter
                their condition nor context.
              </p>
              <p>
                For that reason we based our design on Universal Design for
                Learning, which is about how to incorporate marginalized
                populations in the design of educational material so that it can
                promote learning with equal opportunities since both the regular
                and marginalized population would be equally able to participate.
                This is important so that it can facilitate the implementation in
                mainstream education so that classrooms without students with
                disabilities are interested in implementing these types of
                material because they are also attractive to the regular student
                populations. This way, this type of design takes into
                consideration the variety of context from which the students come,
                rather than the traditional model that only focus on the needs of
                the majority of the students.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this in consideration, so that other iGEM teams could use our
                consideration as well as build upon them, we made some models
                using open source platforms such as Thingiverse. The idea is that
                people without CAD modeling skills are able to look for and adapt
                3D materials easily so that it can be done anywhere with 3D
                printers. Also for people who know CAD modelling we included
                consideration to take into the design so that it is able to be
                adequate for BVIS as well as accurate for use in learning
                classroom. This is also so that Maker communities could be able to
                contribute and reproduce the materials.

              <h3>How it began</h3>
              <p>
                We want the world to have a taste of what synthetic biology really
                is. This is why we developed an innovative and creative way to
                design materials for people with visual disabilities. This is so
                that these populations are able to engage in discussions about the
                Science behind Synthetic Biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                We worked in collaboration with the research group of Dr. Cristina
                Reynaga that was currently on a project of connecting maker
                communities for the development of materials for inclusive
                education. One of Dr. Reynaga’s group developed a prototype of an
                open source device that helps make 3D models interactive for
                inclusive education of the blind and visually impaired.
              </p>
              <p>
                We approached PhD Cristina Reynaga because of her vast experience
                working in the field about how to design our proposal for teaching
                students with visual disabilities about science. Dr Reynaga was
                working on this project about connecting maker communities for the
                design of inclusive materials for education in collaboration with
                UC Berkeley. We came into contact with one of the teams of the
                research project because we were interested in being able to share
                this work internationally on the iGEM platform. For this reason we
                built on the idea further by combining both the maker ideals with
                synthetic biology to develop 3D models to teach about biology
                concepts related to Synbio. An important aspect of the project is
                that all the manufacturing information is of open access so that
                it can be replicated and built upon by other communities all
                around the world. Because of this reason, we wanted to collaborate
                so that other teams are aware of the possibilities of implementing
                these types of technology into their human practices.

              <p>
                In order to achieve this, we designed a user-friendly manual on
                how to design and make inclusive 3D models for STEM education of
                Blind and Visually Impaired Students (BVIS) based on Universal
                Design for Learning, UDL, with a special focus on teaching Biology
                concepts to BVIS. This was based on the experience Dr. Reynaga’s
                research group acquired from the development of their prototype,
                as well as feedback they received from institutions such as
                LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco
                and UC Berkeley,
              </p>
              <p>
                Part of the collaboration was that we developed actual models for
                use with this prototype that will be presented in an International
                Congress for Inclusive Technologies and Education (CONTIE 2019) as
                part of the presentation of Dr. Reynaga’s research team. The idea
                is that the device that Dr. Reynaga’s group developed can be used
                with our models to add audio cues that describe what the object
                is, it’s function in the scientific world and what each texture
                symbolizes or represents so that it can have applications for
                teachers to implement in their classrooms. That way our work can
                be shown to people that have an interest in, and can contribute to
                further explore the potential of this way of making inclusive
                didactic materials..
              </p>
              <p>
                Our main goal with this manual is to share considerations and
                design strategies for teams that are unfamiliar with the subject
                so that they can make and share these designs. Being true to the
                maker spirit of Dr. Reynaga’s project, we also made our original
                designs of open access.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to document this process, we designed the Manual that
                teaches people about open source repositories from which to find
                models to print and adapt to be inclusive, since by nature 3D
                printed material lack the texture richness required to be engaging
                for blind and visually impaired students. Both these methods’ main
                focus is to be appealing for both students with and without visual
                disabilities to promote equal learning opportunities in the
                already existent learning environments.

              Bacteri-on: Educational video game
            </h2>

            <h3>How it began</h3>
            <p>
              After having a clear idea of what we wanted to investigate for our
              project this year, people around us, including friends, family and
              classmates, began to ask us what our work was all about. Many
              times the way in which we tried to communicate our ideas was
              confusing to the general population and nobody understood us when
              we tried to explain it with the relevant scientific terminology.
              We brainstormed ways in which we could creatively attract more
              people and create a simplified version of the theory behind our
              project and the one we considered the best way was to create a
              video game.
            </p>
            <p>
              We teamed up with Computer Science students to develop a video
              game that would transmit what we were looking for. This is how
              Bacteri-On was born, an educational video game that seeks to
              transmit how bacterial resistance is caused and how Synthetic
              Biology is proposing different solutions and looking for
              alternatives to solve this big global problem. We kept the core
              concepts and focused on making it more attractive to learn about
              our project.
            </p>
            <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/4/49/T--Tec-Monterrey--educational-bacterion.jpg"
              class="col-md-9 description-image" />
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              The first step towards constructing this idea and making it happen
              was to establish what we wanted to include in the videogame. We
              had a meeting with the developers to see how we could represent
              what we wanted in a simple way that even those who do nott study
              anything related to Synthetic Biology could understand. After this
              approach, we made some drawings and this is what was created:
            </p>
            <p>
              The game is quite simple. In the main menu it makes you to choose
              3 options: To play, to choose your bacteria or to see the game’s
              instructions. It has 3 levels, easy, intermediate and difficult
              but all consist of the same elements. When it starts, a bacteria
              is located in the center of the screen. In the upper left corner
              there is an antibiotic counter and at the bottom of the screen
              there is a stress meter for the bacteria. There are 2 types of
              dots on the screen. Some very small and others a little larger and
              more resplendent. The first represent stressors with which the
              bacteria can come into contact, while the second represent
              biosensors that capture the presence of new antibiotics that the
              bacteria can produce due to the stress caused. The user, when
              stressing the bacteria will have opportunity to launch new
              antibiotic into de biosensors but there must be a balance between
              the amount of stress the bacteria experiences, as the meter
              increases with every stressor it comes into contact. This stress,
              though, can also cause the bacteria to produce a new antibiotic to
              defend itself. The amount of antibiotics it produces is what is
              reflected in the antibiotic counter. The game ends when the stress
              meter fills up completely, the bacteria dies because of the stress
              it was under, and the score is the amount of new antibiotics your
              bacteria produced.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the game, it displays an informational page in which
              we talk more about antibiotic resistance, its causes and what can
              we all do to lessen the problem, such as taking the complete
              treatment when a Doctor prescribes antibiotics, or avoid taking
              them when they are not prescribed. Alongside with that we also
              mentioned some of the solutions that are arising in the Synthetic
              Biology and area, such as finding ways to discover new
              antibiotics, developing tools to make bacteria weaker or
              antibiotics stronger, developing CRISPR tools to eliminate
              antibiotic resistance, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
              We presented it at one of the science fairs we attended, Conexión
              Tec and the overall feedback was really positive. Several parents
              approached us with kids and while they listened to the verbal
              explanation, the kids played the videogame. It proved to be a way
              of attracting the attention of the youngest, even when it is
              designed for people of any age. The parents' comments were also
              very positive. Some just watched as their children played an
              educational game and enjoyed it, while at the same time being
              somewhat impressed because they were learning something new. We
              did notice however that it could have some improvements related to
              the way in which we represent each concept. Sometimes players
              forgot what the dots meant, or did not comprehend completely how
              was the bacteria stressed or what it was producing. We believe
              that while it is a good idea, and proved to be a good way to
              attract the attention of people wanting to learn something new,
              the way in which we present the information still needs some more
              work to be done.

              GENOMA International Science Congress
            </h2>
            <h3>How it began</h3>
            <p>
              As the curious students that we are, we wanted to find a way in
              which we could join together some scientists for them to teach us
              and our community something new. Last year the Tec-Monterrey team
              organized a National Science congress that people really enjoyed,
              where they learnt about the research areas in our region. But for
              this year we wanted to make it bigger and bring people from all
              over Mexico, with new and relevant research lines that fitted in
              the areas of Synthetic Biology, Nanotechnology, and Health
              Sciences. After a month of planning, we found out that we could
              bring two speakers from other countries, that’s when the GENOMA
              International Science Congress was born.
            </p>

              class="col-md-9 description-image" />
            <p>
              Since our goal was to reach our whole community, we kindly asked
              the speakers to approach the topics in a comprehensible language
              for the undergraduate scientific community to understand. During
              the workshops the participants were able to dive deeper into these
              topics and learn about top research that is being made in
              different institutions. it consisted of 8 conferences and 10
              workshops.
            </p>
            <p>
              The event had a duration of two days andhe event attendees were
              able to attend the following talks and workshops:

              SynBio workshops for school children
            </h2>

            <h3>How it began</h3>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              We wanted to reach as many sectors of the population as we could, that is why we chose to dedicate a
              specific section towards children, our country’s future. We believe the education of the youngest is
              extremely important as it opens up the opportunity for them to learn about topics they may become
              interested
              in the future.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              From the total population of people with disabilities about 58.4% have a visual disability, making it
              the
              second most common disability, just under motor disabilities [3]. For this reason, we saw an area of
              opportunity to teach science to BVIS since we believe that science should be available for everyone no
              matter their condition nor context.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              Especially because of the context in which we find ourselves, educating children allows them to grow up
              knowing things they may not be taught in school, as is the case with Synthetic Biology. I remember that
              in
              my Secondary School, we briefly talked about GMOs, but they were presented to us in a completely wrong
              way,
              like a watermelon with a banana peel. Once you start to know a little more about the subject you realize
              that things do not work that way and that's why we took on the task of spreading not only what a GMO is,
              but
              the way in which Synthetic Biology is developing.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              After talking with Dr. Anahí Dreser from the Institute of Public Health, she mentioned a phrase that had
              a
              great impact on us. She said: "It would be good that just as the new generations are growing with a
              recycling culture, they could grow with a culture of the correct use of antibiotics". Along with this
              phrase, she also introduced us to an educational program developed in the UK, called E-Bug. We took this
              opportunity to link our project and implement it to open a conversation about hygiene, the difference
              between bacteria, viruses and fungi, when to take an antibiotic and when not to.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              From the whole curriculum it offers, we chose to talk about 2 specific topics, Respiratory Hygiene and
              Antibiotic use and medicine. During the workshops we carried out various activities obtained from the
              E-Bug
              page. First we organized a respiratory hygiene activity [4] and after that we applied another activity
              about
              when to take an antibiotic and when not to. [5] We liked both activities because they used very simple
              material everyone can find at home, therefore, they are easy to replicate. Finally we talked about
              Synthetic
              Biology.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              We applied the workshops to two different groups. First to children from the Cystic Fibrosis Regiomonata
              Association (ARFQ) and also to children attending a Science summer camp from a local planetary.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              After talking with Dr. Albino Rivas of the ARFQ, one of the questions we asked him was whether we should
              talk to children with CF about their own disease, to which he answered “yes”. He told us that many times
              they only talk to the parents and the children are not told anything. So for us, it seemed like a good
              idea
              to give them this workshop. We imparted it in a camp we organized at our campus, directed specifically
              at
              children from the ARFQ. The camp, which is also part of our Human Practices consisted of various
              entertaining activities for the children and their parents, as well as this workshop. Once the workshop
              was
              over, we were surprised by some of their answers. Children with CF are very prone to infections so they
              constantly take antibiotics. However, one of the comments of the mother of one of the children was that
              they
              had never been told that they should only be used for that, not to treat viral infections.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              On the other hand, our experience at the summer camp was very different. We imparted the workshop to
              groups
              of children aged 7-8, 9-10 and 11-12. We first did the two hygiene experiments and then started talking
              about Synthetic Biology. For the first experiments, we apply them as the E-Bug page recommended,
              however,
              we
              did have to adapt the content on Synthetic Biology. Language was very important because children can
              lose
              interest if the do not comprehend the information or if it is presented in a very simple, not
              challenging
              enough way.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              Many of the children, especially the older ones, around 11 and 12 years old were very keen to ask
              questions
              about our particular project and what is Synthetic Biology able to accomplish. Several children
              surprised
              us
              because we started talking about how it can be used to cure several genetic illnesses and some even knew
              some information about CRISPR! An actual conversation was established and without even noticing it, we
              were
              both sharing ideas and brainstorming about the future of SynBio. At the end of every session we asked
              the
              children to make a drawing about what they had understood Synthetic Biology was and to our surprise many
              of
              them drew things that accurately represented an aspect of genetic manipulation. This, to us was very
              rewarding because it meant that they had grasped the concept at least to some extent.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 description-text">
              During the workshops we showed the following presentation: <br>

            <h2 class="row col-md-12 subsection-title">Participation in Science fairs</h2>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Expociencias/FENACI </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 description-text">
              We participated in the State science fair for the National Fair for Science and Engineering (FENACI) and
              ExpoCiencias (another state scientific fair) to present our project to attendees and raise awareness
              about
              Cystic Fibrosis. In this instance, over 400 students attended to present their project, as well as the
              general public and several buses filled with students invited from varying public schools in Nuevo León.
              This was a good opportunity to see if people knew about the disease and answer the questions they had as
              well as presenting our research. Most of the people we spoke with did not know about Cystic Fibrosis and
              were curious about Synthetic Biology.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Conexion TEC</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 description-text">
              Conexión Tec is another Science Fair organized by our university for students to engage with businesses
              and
              the general population. We used this opportunity to talk about our project and engage with students,
              businesspeople, teachers and parents. We found that again, not very many people knew about Cystic
              Fibrosis
              and it was also a good opportunity to showcase our videogame, Bacteri-on from which we received some
              feedback from potential users.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2 description-text">
              We found that these experiences are of value because these types of events’ goals are to get the
              students
              as
              well as their families involved in making Science and share their discoveries with others. This way, by
              using the already established mediums for divulging science it is easier for us to get mainstream
              attention
              and share our project. This is an example for other teams to engage in the already existing platforms or
              mediums in order to reach the general population though the most relevant channels.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2 description-text">
              The importance of being able to present your project with people that are non specialized in the area
              since
              it taught us on how to explain technical concepts in a way that it can be easy to understand for people
              who
              are not familiarized. Also being able to answer questions and doubts that the students had helped us
              take
              into consideration aspects of how we presented the project that were not clear, so that we could improve
              how
              we exposed the information and what order was the most logical and easier to understand. This was our
              first
              time presenting our definitive project as a whole so it was really valuable because it allowed us to
              internalize all the work done in order to be able to explain it to someone else, preparing us for the
              eventual presentation that we would have at the Giant Jamboree.
