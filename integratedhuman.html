              In iGEM Tec Monterrey, we managed to integrate the legal and educational aspects related to our research
              and
              thus move from the laboratory to the classrooms and congress to reduce deficiencies in public health and
              education systems. From the beginning we went to experts in public health and Cystic Fibrosis, to know the
              areas that need the most help. Once defined the needs in which we would seek to create a change, we work
              with experts in law and educational development to realize our ideas. This year's work can be summarized
              in
              the following interviews and achievements:

              On Public and Educational Engagement we managed to consult with experts in the area and design several

              Cystic
              Fibrosis in order to establish a two-way conversation about Synthetic Biology and talk more about the
              technological advances in recent years while documenting as much information as possible for future teams
              that wish to build upon what we have achieved.

              In order to learn more about antibiotic resistance in our country, we contacted the National Institute

                On May 16, a call was made with Anahi Dreser, a researcher specialized in antibiotic usage, health
                policies and quality of care of the National Institute of Public Health. With this call we were able to
                know a little more about the current situation of antibiotic resistance in Mexico and analyze
                alternatives
                to generate an impact on society. She told us that the magnitude of the problem itself is unknown
                because
                of the lack of collection of information by governmental entities and because there is a record that
                Mexican doctors tend to misuse antibiotics and patients do not follow their prescribed treatment.
                We could also discuss the impact that a device like the one we propose and the human practices we plan
                will have. Dr. Dreser said:

              This association is dedicated to improve the life quality of patients
              with cystic fibrosis, in the state of Nuevo León, Mexico. They primarily
              give treatments and medications to patients with low incomes, and to achieve

              Through this contact we were able to meet members of the association,

            <h3 class="inner-section-title mt-5">Meeting with Dr. Albino Rivas</h3>
            <p>
              After deciding that we would like to look for a solution to the problem of antibiotic resistance, we found
              ourselves looking for areas where we could apply it. Thanks to one of our team members, we realized that
              antibiotic resistance was an important part of the way Cystic Fibrosis is treated.
            </p>
            <img class="col-md-12 mb-4" src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/2/2c/T--Tec-Monterrey--human-CF.jpg"
              style="padding: 0;">
            <p>
              In published research on the consequences of patients infected with antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa, it
              is mentioned that these people are more susceptible to the symptoms of the disease; it progresses faster
              than normal and this has important implications for infection control, antibiotic use and lung
              transplantation. [1] We sought to do something about it but did not know how to approach the issue.
              Something did call our attention though:
            </p>

                ¿Why was the life expectancy in Mexico 18 years old while the global average was almost 40?
              </button>
              <div class="col-md-12" style="display: none; padding-top: 1em;">
                <p>
                  We looked for information in articles and on the internet, however, we felt that talking to an expert
                  in
                  the
                  field would give us a broader picture of what it means to have CF in Mexico. We found an association
                  that
                  helps people with CF in our city, the Regiomontana Association of Cystic Fibrosis (ARFQ). Our first
                  contact
                  with them took place during a visit we made to their offices where we met one of the doctors in charge
                  of
                  treating many of the patients they support, Dr. Albino Rivas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A meeting was scheduled and held at our university. Dr. Rivas talked to us about the disease and many
                  of
                  the
                  problems faced by CF patients. He pointed out that in our country the treatment for CF patients is
                  inaccessible for most of the population due to its high costs, which is one of the main reasons the
                  life
                  expectancy of people with CF specifically in Mexico is so low compared to the rest of the world. These
                  treatments usually consist of antibiotics to treat infections, enzymes to help digest food, medicines
                  to
                  expectorate sputum and mucolytics that are able to thin out the sputum. At first we were only focusing
                  on
                  antibiotics, he liked our stand on antibiotic resistance and mentioned a really important fact:
                  Doctors
                  can
                  never give CF patients the same antibiotic on four occasions in a row, because after that, patients
                  become
                  resistant to them, even if they take the whole treatment correctly. The mucus that patients have in
                  the
                  lungs is so thick that antibiotics only kill some bacteria but not others, so they become resistant.
                  After a
                  while, patients’ infections are practically impossible to treat and options cease to exist. He did
                  mention
                  though, that for our treatment to be useful for people with CF, other treatment options would be
                  needed
                  in
                  order for new antibiotics to be effective, because then they would only become resistant to the new
                  ones
                  discovered.
                </p>
                <img class="col-md-12 mb-4"
                  src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/7/72/T--Tec-Monterrey--human-doctor2.jpg">
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              After the meeting with Dr. Rivas and a long thought process and brainstorming session, we came up with a
              method to allow antibiotics to more easily reach the bacteria that colonize the lungs of CF patients, by
              creating a mucolytic based on sialidases. By developing both processes at the same time, they would be
              able
              to complement each other and offer a complete treatment.
              <span class="font-weight-bold">The mucolytic would thin the mucus while the new antibiotics would
                penetrate
                deeper and eliminate more bacteria.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, during the meeting Dr. Rivas also mentioned that here in Mexico there are other
              problems
              surrounding the disease. Statistics that seek to report data are often not accurate because there is no
              reliable body that reports all the information, there are many problems in diagnosing the disease because
              many of the pediatric pulmonologists do not know about it so it is confused with other respiratory and
              digestive illnesses. There are also social problems around it: lack of psychological support for patients,
              especially those with scarce resources, problems with parents of children with CF because one of the
              symptoms of the disease is that they cannot digest food well so it is sometimes believed that children
              suffer from malnutrition because of their parents, when in reality they have CF, among many other things
              particular to the disease in the Mexican context. It was after this meeting with the Doctor that we sought
              to relate a little more with the association and help them in whatever we could. The idea of holding a
              rally
              and giving workshops for children, particularly for the association's patients, was also born from here.

                <p>
                  We organized multiple activities with the children of the ARFQ, including a rally and experiments,
                  based
                  on
                  e-Bug, an international platform that aims to reduce antibiotic resistance by creating activities that
                  helps
                  them to comprehend the magnitude of this problematic while also talking about Synthetic Biology and
                  its
                  applications nowadays and in the future. We decided to teach these topics to CF patients because we
                  wanted
                  to transmit them the relevance of taking the appropriate antibiotics when indicated and in the
                  recommended
                  dose.

                  This rally was really meaningful for the whole team, as we all had the opportunity to meet some of the
                  children supported by the association as well as their parents. We did not talk much about CF, paying
                  close
                  attention to avoid topics that may be sensitive for them. The sole purpose of the rally was to get
                  more
                  in
                  touch with the people that could be benefitted from our project and have a fun time while playing
                  games
                  and
                  talking about antibiotic resistance and SynBio. We believe the bonds we made with the families helped
                  us
                  get
                  closer to our project and pay more attention to detail.

                  the city of San Pedro Garza García. Here, we had the opportunity to meet some other patients from the

              On July 17, 2019, we had the opportunity to interview Dr. Paula Isabel Ramírez Ortega, she is in charge of
              the Epidemiology Area of ​​the Apatzingán Michoacán Mexican Institute of Social Insurance, IMSS hospital.
              She told us about the conflict of interest in private offices in the country and why doctors in the public
              sector tend to over-prescribe antibiotics. She said that doctors in the private sector earn more from the
              sale of medicines and that public sector doctors prefer to provide the patient with medications in order
              to
              avoid complaints. In the same way, she explained a little about the idea that society has of antibiotics
              and
              why there is widespread use of them; She concludes that people arrive looking for a quick cure for their
              discomforts and therefore end up consuming medications without knowing for sure if they will serve them.
              Finally, we talked about the shortcomings of the public hospitals of the IMSS and told us about some
              deficiencies with which she lives, which are the following:

              </li>
              <li class="mb-2" style="margin-left: 32px;">
                Nosocomial infections in large hospitals are very persistent and resistant, to the extent that they
                require hospitalization of a person more than 90 days in a row.

            <p>
              The approaches with the experts made us see that innovations in the area of ​​health in our country may
              become obsolete due to the deficiencies of the same health system. In a nutshell, it is no use for finding
              new antibiotics or creating new medications if people or institutions are going to misuse them.
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">
              For that reason, in iGEM Tec Monterrey we decided to leave the laboratory and begin to legislate to create
              a
              change that favors the proper use of medicines and that in the long term fosters the development of a
              national pharmaceutical policy that reduces the deficiencies of the current Mexican health system.

                <p>
                  The inadequate prescription of antibiotics in the Mexican public sector is a serious problem. It has
                  been shown that respiratory and stomach infections are the worst treated. According to Gutierrez et
                  al,
                  "Research carried out mostly during the 1980s and 1990s, concluded that between 60 and 80% of patients
                  with HAIs and EDAS received antibiotics in public and private primary health services in the country,
                  when in fact their use was justified only in 10 to 15% of the cases. "[2]. Additionally, it is known
                  that justified prescriptions are made in the most advanced hospitals. Nevertheless, many of the doses
                  or
                  treatments provided were excessive, which represents a serious threat to patients. In conclusion, most
                  antibiotic prescriptions are unjustified or inadequate and this has negative consequences for society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In monetary terms, the inappropriate use of antibiotics comes to represent 11% of the public spending
                  in
                  health. This expense is caused by incorrect prescriptions and the lack of follow-up of treatments by
                  patients. In addition, the incorrect prescriptions of medications come to represent 1 or 2 percent
                  more
                  than the patient's daily minimum wage. The bad prescriptions come to represent a large economic spill
                  that affects the Mexican economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Mexico, a large part of the strategies implemented have been in the educational area and directives
                  of the health sector. First, training in prescriptions in medical schools began to improve. This was
                  intended to improve prescriptions for respiratory and stomach infections. In the same way, the use of
                  clinical guidelines for better prescriptions in public health institutes was encouraged. [3]
                  Nevertheless, there is no study that talks about the results of the implementation of these
                  techniques.
                  In a few words, it has sought to improve prescriptions in Mexico, but it is not known if it is
                  working.

                <p>
                  In order to begin a change in the subject of legislation in the area of ​​health, iGEM Tec Monterrey
                  began to promote an amendment to the <span class="font  -weight-bold">Official Mexican Standard
                    NOM-072-SSA1-2012.</span> This rule establishes
                  the guidelines to follow in the labeling of medicines in Mexico, of which we proposed an improvement
                  in
                  the warnings about the damage of antibiotics and the modification of an article to force
                  pharmaceutical
                  companies to improve their labeling and the information provided about your medications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our strategy was to start with the modification of a rule that directly affects society. With this
                  modification, clearer and more concise information on medicines would be offered to society. This type
                  of modification would lead to the proper use of free medications and antibiotics, as well as to warn
                  in
                  a stronger way the risk involved in the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to the above, it will be a precedent to propose further modifications in the national
                  health
                  sector. Modifications that seek to establish a clearer authority for the health sector, strengthen
                  health regulations and improve the education system of the health sciences area.

                <p>
                  In order to make our proposal a reality, we took on the task of seeking help in the local congress of
                  the state of Nuevo León (Mexico), where we were able to collaborate with the deputy Rosa Isela Castro
                  who is part of the health commission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initially, we were able to present our bill to the deputy and her team, with them we were able to
                  discuss the pros and cons of this initiative, in addition to the legal mechanisms to make it happen.
                  With this meeting we could review our proposed law at the federal level, which was as follows:
                </p>
                <div class="d-flex col-md-12 justify-content-around mb-4">

                </div>
                <p>
                  With this first approach we define that the main changes for the Official Mexican Standard
                  NOM-072-SSA1-2012 would be the following:
                </p>
                <ul class="card-component" style="list-style: circle; background-color: var(--iGEM-light-orange);">
                  <li class="mb-2" style="margin-left: 32px;">
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Modification of the article 5.12.7,</span> defining the warning that
                    antibiotics should contain about
                    antibacterial resistance. However, its effectiveness and understanding are limited, so it was agreed
                    to propose a more forceful and visible message.
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-2" style="margin-left: 32px;">
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Modification of the article 7.3,</span>
                    the wording of this article makes the placement of informative inserts optional in the labeling of
                    over-the-counter medications and antibiotics. To offer more information to the consumer and promote
                    more appropriate use of medicines, we proposed to make the placement of informative inserts and the
                    creation of methodologies that allow the creation of effective inserts mandatory.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Then, an exhort was prepared for the secretary of health of the state of Nuevo León, with which he was
                  invited to begin the process to make this modification to the Mexican congress. This exhortation was
                  analyzed and approved unanimously by the Congress of Nuevo León and set the first precedent for this
                  proposed law.
