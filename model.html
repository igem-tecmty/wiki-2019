                Designing synthetic biological circuits using genetic elements
                has become a research field for developing novel biochemical sensors.
                Specifically Bacterial cell based biosensors have been studied for the environmental
                monitoring, clinical diagnostics and drug discovery. One of the main challenges
                for this biosensors to meet real-life applications is the low sensibility and
                deficient detection limits.

                The rise of multiple antibotic resistant bacteria and the evident crisis
                in drug discovery has become one of the main challenges in human history.
                Traditional screening not only takes longer times,from years to decades,
                but often fails to discover novel biomolecules. Bacterial biosensors have provided
                a novel benchmark for the screening of secondary metabolites producers, boosting
                the discovery of antibiotics and broadening the spectrum of the latter.
                One of main aspects that should be considered for the development of novel
                antibiotic biosensors is the sensibility, since they can only work properly below
                the minimum inhibitory concentration.

                Our project consists of a series of engineered multi-layered transcriptional amplifiers that
                sequentially increases the output expression level of a GFP reporter protein by the presence of an
                antibiotic belonging to a specific mechanism of action (MOA) in order to enhanced the process of drug
                discovery and bacterial screening.

                Modelling Biological systems has become an area of interest for multidisciplinary areas of science,
                medicine and engineering. Mathematical models allow to understand and predict the behavior of complex
                systems using simple concepts.

                Bacterial bio-sensors can be divided into three modules, the first comprising a sensing module that
                recognizes the external signal and transduces into a transcriptional output, the computing module that
                modulates the transduced sensor signal and the output module which executes the physiological output
                response. In this project, we develop mathematical models for the engineered multi-layered
                transcriptional amplifiers which acts as a computing module using both exact deterministic differential
                equations and stochastic simulations to provide a proof of concept for the amplification signal of the
                antibiotic biosensor.

                The structure of the following sections goes as follows: First we derive the mathematical equations for
                an already characterized heavy metal biosensor consisting of a constitutive promoter expressing a
                repressor protein inhibiting the later expression of a reporter gene. Then we will consider the effect
                of adding a mono-layer orthogonal transcriptional amplifier to the signal amplification. After that we
                will extrapolate this same models to our antibiotic biosensor.

                  The fisrt system to be modelled consist of an heavy metal

                  promoter expresses a repressor protein that inactivates the

                  to work correctly is a low efficiency constitutive promoter
                  such that in the presence of heavy metal inducer the gfp
                  signal can be turned on. Another important requirement is
                  that the arsenic repressor interactions be stronger than the
                  promoter-repressor in order to overcome such inhibition and
                  lower the detection limits of the heavy metal.

              Compared to single phase flows, microfluidic two-phase flows relies on several physical phenomena that
              need to be controlled for the droplets to fully form. The flow properties in microchannels rely on three
              parameters: the channel geometry, the properties of both fluids, and the flow conditions. These factors
              can be described by some important dimensionless parameters.

                  The physics behind microfluidics include the relations between the interfacial tension, inertial
                  forces and the involved fluids’ properties. Dimensionless numbers have become a standard manner to
                  compare fluid interaction at macro and micro scale.

                  The flow in microfluidic systems are usually characterized by low Reynolds number values, which
                  describes the ratio between inertial and viscous forces in fluids, and can be used to characterize the
                  system.

                  Where ρ is the density of the fluid (kg/m3), V is the average fluid velocity (m/s), L is the linear
                  dimension (m) and µ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (kg/ms). In microfluidic systems, viscous
                  forces (µ) dominate and Reynolds numbers are generally smaller than 100, leading to the prevalence of
                  laminar flow. For Re << 1 the flow is dominated by viscous stresses and pressure gradients, hence
                    inertial effects are negligible, and the trajectories of fluidic psections can be controlled
                    precisely. </P> <P>
                    The dominant forces at the microscale are <b>interfacial and viscous forces</b>, therefore it is
                    important to determine the relative importance of the interfacial tension compared to other forces
                    in droplet generation. The capillary number Ca is the ratio of viscous stress to capillary pres

                  the interfacial tension of the liquid-liquid interface. At low Ca (<1) the interfacial tension
                    dominates, and spherical droplets are found. In contrast, at high Ca (>>1) the viscous forces play
                    an important role, leading to deformation of the droplets and sometimes to asymmetric shapes.
                    Suryo & Basaran had previously reported a phases map in which different droplet generation regimes
                    were identified at different ranges of Ca numbers for both continuous and disperse phases [numero].
                    The squeezing regime generates well-rounded monodisperse droplets at high throughput and has defined
                    boundary conditions for the Ca numbers as shown in Figure 1. Hence a prediction can be made based on
                    the parameters considered in the Ca in order to generate monodisperse droplets in the squeezing

                  The interfacial effects become relevant when working at microscale and are crucial in multi-phase
                  flows. The interfaces considered in microfluidic two-phase systems include the fluid-wall and
                  fluid-fluid interfaces. The wetting properties of the fluid-wall interface are important to determine
                  whether there will be an ordered droplet production or not. If there is a complete wetting of the
                  continuous phase in the microchannels, an orderly pattern can be achieved. The hydrophobicity or
                  hydrophilicity of a solid surface can be expressed quantitatively by contact angles. The contact angle
                  between a liquid and a solid is the angle formed by the tangent from the contact point along the
                  gas-liquid interface. If the contact angle between a liquid and a solid is less than 90° the liquid
                  will wet the surface and spread over it. If the contact angle is ≥90°, the liquid will stay on the
                  surface as a bead. Therefore, the* contact angle between a liquid and a solid is dependent on the
                  nature of the liquid as well as the surface characteristics of the solid. Water-in-oil (W/O) droplets
                  can be achieved in hydrophobic surfaces that have a contact angle higher than 90°, in which the
                  droplet will not spread over the surface; nevertheless, it is possible to modify the contact angle by
                  adding surfactants at different con

                  Surfactants are often used in order to modify the contact angle between the fluid-wall
                  interface. They are also used to reduce the interfacial tension between fluids and to prevent
                  the coalescence or merging of droplets [13]. In the presence of surfactants, the interfacial
                  tension is determined by the competition between interfacial deformation and surfactant
                  convection, diffusion and adsorption–desorption kinetics during droplet generation [3]. A faster
                  interfacial deformation and slower mass transfer process causes the surface coverage of
                  surfactants to become smaller, thereby the interfacial tension turns larger [13].

                  Properties of the fluids (i.e., viscosity, density, interfacial tension) and design parameters
                  (i.e., geometry, dimensions, flow rates) are the main variables responsible for the formation of
                  continuous monodisperse droplets in a microfluidic system.

                  The droplet breakup process in microfluidic devices has been extensively studied, and several
                  mechanisms have been classified based on the droplet generation. The most important mechanism is
                  the squeezing regime, since this produces continuous monodisperse droplets in defined intervals
                  of time.

                <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/6/6d/T--Tec-Monterrey--hw-regimes.png" class="col-12 description-image">
                <p>
                  The droplet breaking process is not fully understood since it is dependent on many parameters,
                  nevertheless a good approximation can be made based on design parameters including flow rate,
                  viscosities, and geometry of the device.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the viscous forces and capillary forces are the dominant forces in the droplet breakup and
                  capillary numbers relate those terms, they are essential in the determination of design
                  parameters for droplet formation. Based on the known physical parameters of the fluids being
                  used, it can be possible to calculate the best velocities at which the fluids begin the droplet
                  formation in the squeezing regime.

                  A MATLAB script was developed in order to determine the optimized velocities and hence the flow
                  rates for droplet generation based on the boundary conditions of the squeezing regime. The
                  following figure is an example of the scatter map created based on the conditions available in
                  literature, the physical parameters of the fluids (interfacial tension, density, and kinematic
                  viscosity), and the geometry of the channel (width and length). The flow rate conditions were
                  used as parameters into a COMSOL simulation in order to determine the optimized flow rates that
                  could generate continuous monodisperse droplets in order to try them in the experimental section
                  of the microfluidic device.

                  As previously discussed, the role of viscosity, effect of flow rates, and geometries of the
                  microfluidic device are of great relevance on droplet formation [1]. Nevertheless, the experimental
                  and empirical investigations that focus on these effects are usually subject to spend a large amount
                  of resources, time, and effort in order to achieve an optimized set of conditions for droplet
                  generation, since there is a high chance of failure at initial stages of the design process [2],
                  [3]. Therefore, a numerical study of microdroplet generation could provide a suitable model for the
                  prediction of the effects of the previously mentioned parameters on a droplet generation T-junction
                  microfluidic device.

                  A reliable simulation may be a suitable method to reduce the required time to achieve an optimized
                  characteristic of the system, and to be able to forecast how the different modifications of the
                  parameters will impact on the droplet generation [3]. In order to determine the effect of different
                  flow rates of both phases and their relation to droplet size and monodispersity, simulations were
                  carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics which includes a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) module and
                  a microfluidics module as well [4].

                <p>
                  CFD provides a reliable alternative in order to obtain insights into a complicated process. Several
                  methods have been typically used in order to simulate two-phase fluidic systems, including volume of
                  fluid (VOF) method, level-set method (LS), phase-field method, and lattice-Boltzmann method.
                  Although there are several advantages regarding the different methods, the LS method represents the
                  interface by a smooth function, and it is convenient for calculating the curvature and surface
                  tension forces [5]. Hence, it seems to be suitable for modeling droplet breakup process in
                  microfluidic devices. In the proposed simulations, we employed LS method to study the
                  droplet-breakup process using FC40 as the continuous phase, and water as the dispersed phase. The
                  effects of the capillary number (Ca) and the different flow rates are investigated [3].

                  COMSOL Multiphysics determines the modules that are needed in order to give solving parameters, the
                  dimensions in which the experiment will be performed, and the definition of the physics of the
                  problem. For this simulation, we used a laminar two-phase flow using the level set method. A
                  single-phase flow system is less complicated to model computationally than the multiphase flow due
                  to fewer partial differential equations that need to be solved parallelly. Nevertheless, it is
                  needed a two-phase system in order to properly simulate the relationship between the dispersed and
                  continuous phases.

                  In order to analyze the motion of a liquid, the starting equation to use is the Navier-Stokes
                  equation. The following assumptions are made in order to simplify the model: a constant fluid
                  density, a laminar flow regime exists throughout the system, all fluids are Newtonian, and
                  three-dimensional stresses for a fluid obey Hooke’s law [6]. While assuming the above, the
                  incompressible form of the Navier-Stokes equation is as follows:

                  The first design is a three-dimensional T-junction composed of two inlets. The inlet for Fluid 1 had
                  a width of 100 µm and a length of 400 µm prior to the junction. The inlet for Fluid 2 had an inlet
                  width of 100 µm and length of 300 µm prior to reaching the junction, as can be seen in the following
                  figure. Post T-junction, the droplets travel 600 µm to the expanded pillar induced merging chamber.
                  The entire geometry has a depth of 100µm.

                  The main goal of the simulation is to generate droplets. Droplet generation commonly occurs by
                  shearing one fluid phase with another. Utilizing the T-junction defined previously with the
                  parameters based on the MATLAB script. All physical parameters are based on literature. Since the
                  goal was to see whether the conditions could generate droplets or not, the results are only
                  qualitative with a binary response on whether or not a droplet was formed. The next steps for this
                  simulations were to test the given parameters that could make droplets in the experimental setup.
