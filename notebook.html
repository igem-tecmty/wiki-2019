              Many people think that we are at the beginning of the post-antibiotic era
              due to antimicrobial resistance, which has become a serious problem all around
              the world in the last decades. This resistance reduces the effectiveness of
              medications and bacterial infections become more frequent, long-lasting and harder to attack.
              Bacterial resistance has reached such an uncontrolled level that now bacteria like
              Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas have become super-resistant.
              This means that they are almost immune to all antibiotics used to fight them and are
              especially dangerous in hospitals and health care centers.

              Many people think that we are at the beginning of the post-antibiotic era
              due to antimicrobial resistance, which has become a serious problem all around
              the world in the last decades. This resistance reduces the effectiveness of
              medications and bacterial infections become more frequent, long-lasting and harder to attack.
              Bacterial resistance has reached such an uncontrolled level that now bacteria like
              Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas have become super-resistant.
              This means that they are almost immune to all antibiotics used to fight them and are
              especially dangerous in hospitals and health care centers.
