            <p>
              Microfluidics is a subset of fluid mechanics that integrates physics and engineering on a micrometer
              length scale [2]. For microfluidic systems, flow rates operate in small volumes, ranging from microliters
              (10^-6) to picolitres (10^-12) inside micrometric (10^-6 μm) channels. The small dimensions in which these
              systems are driven allows a wide number of advantages over conventional techniques that use reaction
              vessels, test tubes or microliter plates, which include more predictable systems with high-throughput
              experimentation capabilities, a smaller volume of sample needed, a shorter time to gather results, and the
              possibility to execute multiple parallel tests [5], [15].

            <p class="description-text">
              Microfluidic systems take advantage of the properties of fluid flow on the microscale to the widest
              possible range. Research in this area include theoretical analysis, fluid behavior and applications
              based on this regime [16]. Microfluidic platforms operate both in the continuous flow regime and in the
              segmented flow regime. In the second case, droplets are used as individual reaction chambers, alike
              conventional techniques used in standard laboratories, but orders of magnitude smaller with higher
              control and precision [3].
            </p>
            <p class="description-text">
              Droplet-based microfluidics is an adaptable tool for extensive applications, attributed to have a number
              of
              advantages [6],[8]-[10]. In a channel microfluidic device, two separate and immiscible liquid streams are
              forced into channels. The shear force at the point where they meet creates (usually aqueous) droplets that
              are encased within a continuous fluid (generally oil). Each droplet is a self-contained vessel, isolated
              from other droplets and from the channel walls by the oil phase.

                  Several different techniques for droplet generation have been extensively proposed and reviewed in
                  macroscopic configurations [1],[12],[15]. Nevertheless, these methods cannot produce monodisperse
                  droplets,
                  thus making them unsuitable for biological or medical applications. Hence, microfluidic techniques
                  have
                  been
                  proposed in order to overcome these limitations.
                  The highly complex physics of droplet generation in microfluidic systems is not completely understood
                  yet,
                  but there is enough information in order to implement droplets on microfluidic devices successfully.
                  There
                  are three main techniques for droplet generation that have been conventionally used: T-junction, co
                  flow,
                  and flow focusing. Each technique has a different mechanism of pinch-off in order to form the droplets
                  as
                  depicted in figure 1.

                  <h3 class="mb-2">T-junction</h3>
                  <p>
                    The T-junction method uses a simple junction (often formed like the letter “T”) where the continuous
                    and
                    the dispersed phase meet at an angle. The disperse phase upon reaching the continuous phase pinches
                    off
                    in
                    the droplet form, induced by shear stress exerted by the continuous phase, and gets carried in its
                    stream
                    [13]. The droplet detaches from the fluid thread before it can block the full width of the
                    continuous
                    phase channel. This is a straightforward method and different regimes are obtained based on the
                    capillary
                    number [9].
                  </p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                  <h3 class="mb-2">Co flow</h3>
                  <p>
                    In the co flow design, the dispersed phase and the continuous phase meet in parallel. A capillary is
                    inserted in a surrounding channel in such a way that the fluid in the surrounding channel completely
                    engulfs the capillary and any liquid that is ejected out of it [12]. Therefore, the channel carrying
                    the
                    water phase is completely covered by the oil stream. This method is again dominated by the capillary
                    number or rather the flow rates of the two streams yielding different flow regimes [4].

                  <p>
                    This model is a modified version of the co-flow device and produces more uniform droplets than the
                    T-junction and the co-flow systems. Here the co flowing of two or more phases are accelerated and
                    elongated in a constriction of the channel (orifice). The presence of the orifice structure in the
                    parallel flow system creates different flow regimes based on the flow rates of the two phases [13].

            <p class="description-text">
              The techniques mentioned above are used to produce droplets in numerous different purposes. The geometry
              used is dependent on the application and the specifications needed. The droplet size depends on several
              parameters such as the geometry, the flow rates and the liquids being used. Flow focusing devices usually
              need a more precisely controlled production and accurate control of parameters in order to produce
              droplets
              at a higher monodispersity and can generate smaller size droplets at a higher rate compared to
              T-junctions.
              Co flow devices’ behavior is hard to control compared to T-junctions or flow focusing and finally
              T-junctions may not generate droplets as monodisperse as the ones in a flow focusing device, however this
              kind of device is the most used and documented.
            </p>
            <p class="description-text">
              As these methods require a precise control of the flow rate to generate monodisperse droplets, which is
              difficult to reach especially with syringe pumps, but taking into account our resources and time
              availability we decided to go ahead with a T-junction device, especially because we found many references
              that define parameters we can use instead of obtaining them ourselves.

            <p class="description-text">
              In order to fulfill the design considerations regarding the microfluidic device, a number of different
              design ideas were sketched using AutoCAD 2019. Once a microfluidic device design was sketched, it went
              through a redesign and development process in order to have an optimized model based on previous
              literature
              and known good practice parameters. As previously discussed, the microfluidic device should have a
              droplet
              generator, a spacer, a second droplet generation, a reservoir, and an outlet for recovery. For the
              droplet
              generator, two geometries were taken into account, a T-junction and a flow-focusing device, but based on
              a
              literature search and the microfluidics model section, a T-junction was preferred based on its
              simplicity.
              The following figure shows the first sketched models.

              A microfluidic device was designed based on the microfluidics model parameters section in order to
              generate
              monodisperse droplets in two different junctions. The first junction needed to generate droplets using a
              T-junction, then go through a spacer in order to prevent coalescence or merging of the droplets, then a
              second T-junction would be added in order to generate the second droplet, after these droplets were
              mixed,
              a
              reservoir chamber is used to visualize and count the droplets, and finally an outlet for recollecting
              the
              mixed droplets. The final proposed design is shown in the following figure.

              Once the design was validated as a good candidate for the requirements given, a number of different
              variations were also made by adding a second spacer after the mixing, and changing the number of
              spacers.
              These different versions were added into a single file and a mask was ordered from CAD/Art services,

              With the masks, a master mold was fabricated using SU8-2007 over a glass slide. Although a silicon
              wafers
              is
              the gold standard to use as a substrate, we couldn’t use them because they are too expensive. This
              process
              was based on the MicroChem SU-8 data sheet as a starting point, but we had to make a number of changes
              and
              develop our own process based on the availability of resources.
            </p>
            <p class="description-text">
              One of the biggest issues was that we didn’t have a cleanroom, hence all fabrication procedures were
              made
              in
              a dark room, however dust and other particles could be in the environment, making the process more
              difficult
              with the possibility of having a non-functional master mold or blocked channels. After the fabrication
              of
              the SU8 master, a microfluidic device with the proposed geometry was fabricated using standard soft
              lithography techniques.

              channels using a plasma surface activation. Once the final microfluidic device was made, the proposed
              flow
              conditions were tested and the results were compared with the simulations (see model). Syringe pumps
              were
              used to maintain a continuous flow rate of both the disperse and continuous phases, the syringe pump
              flow
              rate is defined by the user and is the main control parameter for the generation of the droplets.

              A set of conditions based on the droplet breakup simulations were taken into account, the flow rate
              of the
              continuous phase was changed from 1 to 50 µm/min, while leaving the disperse phase constant at 1
              µm/min in
              order to use the smallest possible amount of reagent to optimize the biological sample. Two droplets
              of
              different content are forced to be in contact and to merge, then the mixed droplet passes through
              the
              remaining channel into a reservoir to contabilize and see the monodispersity of the generated
              droplets.
              Finally, the droplets are recaptured in a vial for further experimentation.
