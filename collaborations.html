            Since we began to develop our project, we looked for teams that were located close to us as an opportunity
            to share our ideas and look to opportunities to collaborate in the future. We kept close attention to team
            UANL and team UAAAN, as they belong to universities that have worked with past Tec-Monterrey teams.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            Both teams contacted us so we could start sharing the projects we were elaborating. Once we agreed on a date
            to get together, both teams came to our college campus, where we opened a space for discussion. Each team
            had the opportunity to explain the theory behind their project and share the progress they had made so far.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            During this first approach with both teams, we raised the possibility of collaborating, hosting the Latin
            American Meetup. After dropping hints through social media that we wanted to organize the meetup, another
            team contacted us, Tec-Chihuahua. Because they are located farther away than the 3 initial teams we had
            agreed to collaborate with, we started talking by video call. Finally, only formal collaboration was
            established between Tec-Monterrey, Tec-Chihuahua, and UANL, which is how the organization for the LATAM
            MEETUP began.

          <p class="description-text">
            One of our main purposes was to innovate and build upon what other teams had achieved in the past, which is
            a little bit complicated, considering Latin America is a very large region and there are not very many teams
            compared to other regions.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            We looked for different strategies to attract more participants from other iGEM teams and it occurred to us
            that probably more people would come if they had a reason to stay a little longer than the day that was
            going to last the meetup. This is why we put the dates of the International Congress GENOMA and the meetup
            together. August 29th and 30th would be the first one, while the 31st would be meetup. In addition, we
            wanted to provide workshops that would be useful to the iGEM community. These are usually more attractive
            than a conference, because it allows us to apply the knowledge acquired in our own projects.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text mb-1">
            The workshops that were imparted were the following:
            <ul style="list-style: circle;">
              <li style="margin-left: 32px;">
                Modelling in Synthetic Biology
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left: 32px;">
                What comes after iGEM
              </li>

                How to organize your wiki

                iGEM for Dummies

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            We also organized the schedule to accommodate a space in which we had the workshops, a networking sessión
            and project presentations all in one day. Finally, in collaboration with iGEM Tec Chihuahua and UANL we
            hosted in Monterrey, N.L., a MeetUp for the Latin American region. The event occurred on August 31 in our
            campus facilities where we welcomed iGEM teams ITESO Guadalajara, Tec Chihuahua and UANL. The event started
            with the workshops mentioned above. We received good feedback on the content as it was not focused on a
            particular area or project, rather it could be applied by any iGEM team. Next, each team did a short poster
            presentation of their project and received feedback from PhD. Maximiliano Medina, MSc. Heber Torres and
            other iGEM teams. During the event we connected with more team Tec Chihuahua members via Zoom video chat and
            live broadcasted the workshops in our social media so other LATAM teams could follow up. The event meant a
            huge opportunity to network with after iGEMers and experts in Synthetic Biology. We also created strong
            bonds with iGEM teams in the region by sharing recommendations, presenting our work and pointing out their
            projects strengths and areas of opportunity.

              We got involved with other iGEM teams from all around the world in a Social Media Challenge organized by
              iGEM Stonybrook. For a whole week we participated in daily challenges which consisted in revealing our
              project, uploading videos of lab bonding, sharing agar art images among others. This collaboration helped
              us
              connect with other iGEM teams around the world and learn what they were preparing for the Giant Jamboree.
              It
              was also a great opportunity to integrate with many of the other teams that participated and to better
              connect with our social media audience, sharing relevant information to make us known and what we were
              working on for almost an entire year.

            In collaboration with team Tec-Guadalajara, we did a troubleshooting meeting through the Zoom, video chat
            platform. The team explained to us they were having problems with the correct ligation of their parts. We
            noticed we had some differences in our methods, such as the ligation time and amount of DNA we added to the
            reaction, so we shared with them our standardized protocols and some pro tips that worked well for us.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            This was very helpful for us since last week before the videochat, we had trouble with the protocol which
            had worked for us in previous ligations. Tec-Guadalajara team managed to carry out the protocols with
            successful results (positive bacterial transformations), which indicated the reproducibility of our protocol
            and discard problems in our work.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            In another video chat meeting we learned that Team Tec-Guadalajara had also experienced working with blind
            and visually impaired people (see “ Educational & Public engagement” section), so we asked them to
            collaborate with us on our Touch and Listen manual by sharing their experience designing a rally based on
            an
            educational model approved by the Ministry of Public Education, SEP by its acronym in Spanish. We shared
            in
            return our experience on designing materials based on Universal Design for Learning, which could help them
            make their educational rally become inclusive for people with visual disabilities.
